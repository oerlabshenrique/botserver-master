*This is a General Bots open core package, more information can be found on the [BotServer](https://github.com/pragmatismo-io/BotServer) repository.*

This alpha version is using a hack in form of converter to
translate BASIC to TS and string replacements to emulate await code.
See http://jsfiddle.net/roderick/dym05hsy for more info on vb2ts, so
http://stevehanov.ca/blog/index.php?id=92 should be used to run it without
translation and enhance classic BASIC experience.
